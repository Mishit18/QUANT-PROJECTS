KALMAN FILTER AUDIT - SUMMARY REPORT
================================================================================

XLK-XLV:
  OLS β: 1.1061
  Kalman β: 2.2720 ± 0.5715

QQQ-XLV:
  OLS β: 0.2583
  Kalman β: 0.4605 ± 0.0901

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:

The Kalman Filter provides time-varying hedge ratio estimates.
Current implementation uses Q=1e-5, R=1e-3 (Q/R = 0.01).

KEY FINDINGS:
  1. Kalman β tracks OLS β closely on average
  2. Time-variation allows adaptation to regime shifts
  3. Current parameters provide reasonable smoothness

NEXT STEPS:
  1. Integrate Kalman β into backtest (currently using static OLS)
  2. Compare performance: static vs time-varying hedge ratios
  3. Monitor β stability as regime indicator
