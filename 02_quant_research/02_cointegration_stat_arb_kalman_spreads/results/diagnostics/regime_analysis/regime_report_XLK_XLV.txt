REGIME INSTABILITY ANALYSIS: XLK-XLV
================================================================================

OVERALL REGIME STABILITY: 0.9% of time in STABLE regime
UNSTABLE PERIODS: 99.1% of time

STABILITY BREAKDOWN BY CRITERION:
  - Stationarity (ADF):        5.7%
  - Cointegration (Johansen):  8.3%
  - Half-Life Stability:       85.6%
  - High Correlation (>0.7):   54.8%
  - Normal Volatility:         87.2%

MOST UNSTABLE PERIODS:
  - 2016-01-04 to 2016-08-09 (149 days)
  - 2016-08-19 to 2021-04-14 (1170 days)
  - 2021-04-21 to 2021-04-21 (1 days)
  - 2021-04-28 to 2023-12-29 (673 days)

MEAN-REVERSION CHARACTERISTICS:
  - Average half-life: inf ± nan days
  - Median half-life:  27.5 days
  - Min half-life:     7.8 days
  - Max half-life:     inf days

INTERPRETATION:
  ⚠️  CRITICAL: Pair is unstable >50% of the time
  → Statistical arbitrage assumptions frequently violated
  → Strategy should NOT be traded without regime filters

FAILURE MODE ANALYSIS:
  - Spread frequently non-stationary → Cointegration breaking down
  - Johansen test frequently fails → Relationship is weak
  - Correlation drops frequently → Relationship weakening
