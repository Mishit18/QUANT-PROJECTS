REGIME INSTABILITY ANALYSIS: QQQ-XLV
================================================================================

OVERALL REGIME STABILITY: 0.3% of time in STABLE regime
UNSTABLE PERIODS: 99.7% of time

STABILITY BREAKDOWN BY CRITERION:
  - Stationarity (ADF):        3.2%
  - Cointegration (Johansen):  5.2%
  - Half-Life Stability:       80.7%
  - High Correlation (>0.7):   57.6%
  - Normal Volatility:         87.2%

MOST UNSTABLE PERIODS:
  - 2016-01-04 to 2021-04-15 (1330 days)
  - 2021-04-21 to 2023-12-29 (676 days)

MEAN-REVERSION CHARACTERISTICS:
  - Average half-life: inf ± nan days
  - Median half-life:  27.4 days
  - Min half-life:     8.5 days
  - Max half-life:     inf days

INTERPRETATION:
  ⚠️  CRITICAL: Pair is unstable >50% of the time
  → Statistical arbitrage assumptions frequently violated
  → Strategy should NOT be traded without regime filters

FAILURE MODE ANALYSIS:
  - Spread frequently non-stationary → Cointegration breaking down
  - Johansen test frequently fails → Relationship is weak
  - Correlation drops frequently → Relationship weakening
