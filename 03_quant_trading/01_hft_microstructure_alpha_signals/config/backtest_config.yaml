# Backtesting configuration

backtest:
  # Execution parameters
  latency_events: 1  # minimum delay between signal and execution
  
  # Position limits
  max_position: 1000  # maximum inventory (shares)
  position_limit_pct: 0.5  # fraction of max position per trade
  
  # Risk management
  stop_loss_ticks: 5  # stop loss in ticks
  take_profit_ticks: 10  # take profit in ticks
  
  # Transaction costs
  half_spread_cost: true  # pay half spread on market orders
  fixed_cost_bps: 0.0  # additional fixed cost in basis points
  
  # Signal thresholds
  entry_threshold: 0.6  # minimum prediction probability
  exit_threshold: 0.4  # exit when probability drops below
  
  # Sizing
  base_size: 100  # base order size
  scale_by_confidence: true  # scale size by prediction confidence
  scale_by_spread: true  # reduce size when spread is wide
  
  # Evaluation
